### Prerequisites

You must have the latest version of Xcode & the command-line tools for Xcode installed.

### Install

To install, copy and paste the following piece of code into your terminal.

    python -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/davidvuong/dotfiles/master/install.py`"

### Themes

I'm using solarized themes for both VIM and iterm2. To use them as well:

    iTerm>Preferences>Profiles>Colors>Load Presets...
    ... locate ~/dotfiles/iterm2/solarized
    ... pick a theme (dark or light)
    ... then use it (what we did earlier was just an import)

Finally, set zsh as the default shell when we open up a terminal session:

    iTerm>Preferences>Profiles>General>Command>Command>zsh

### Applications

The following are apps that could not be installed automatically.
