### Install:

    python -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/davidvuong/dotfiles/master/install.py`"

### Themes:

    iTerm>Preferences>Profiles>Colors>Load Presets...
    ... locate ~/dotfiles/iterm2/solarized
    ... pick a theme (dark or light)
    ... then use it (what we did earlier was just an import)

Set zsh as the default shell when we open up a terminal session:

    iTerm>Preferences>Profiles>General>Command>Command>zsh
