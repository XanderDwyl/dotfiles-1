# vscode

This directory stores keybindings and the general editor configuration file. I haven't done much research but I couldn't easily find a way to encode installed and enabled plugins into code so here is also a list of plugins I use:

- ESLint
- Prettier
- Terraform
- React Native Tools (disabled for non RN projects)
- One Dark Pro (theme)
- Vim
